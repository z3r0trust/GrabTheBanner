# GrabTheBanner
my tiny banner grabber tool

a banner is a simply the text that is embedded with a message that is received from a host.
usually this text includes signatures of applications that issue the message. so, they reveal themselves to us

there are so many techniques and tools that grabs the banner.
but there are such scenarios, we are unable to use these tools, so we have to build anon programs that solves our problems.

also, if you are curious what is behind the scene, you can code your own program.
